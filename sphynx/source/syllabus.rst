Welcome to the SimCenter Programming Bootcamp 2024.
Following the success of our online version of this workshop,
this year's **offering will be solely online**.

**Why are we offering the workshop online?**

* The online format allows easy access at low cost makes this format the most equitable and accessible 
  and affordable version of the SimCenter Bootcamp.
* You can expect to collaborate with students from across the globe and enjoy 
  the oportunity to make new friends at unexpected places.
* Our mentor system allows alumni of this workshop series to return, share their experience,
  and help you learn from a community of like-minded graduate students and post-docs.
* The SimCenter team is putting in all effort to recreate some of the community building benefits
  through discussion sessions and social time.


**The bootcamp is organized** as two weeks of daily self-study assignments, 
followed by three (3) hours of online lectures and exercises via ZOOM,
followed by homework assignments and some more self-study video sessions.
Every morning, office hours are held for one (1) hour before
the actual meetings.

These two weeks are offered as individual or as one combined workshop as follows.

   The Python workshop is geared towards beginner and intermediate level material.
   The first three days will cover and refresh basic concepts of python, 
   as well as fundamentals of code design.
   Thursday will transition you to command-line use of python, as you'll need on any 
   high-performance computing (HPC) environment. 
   The workship will conclude on Friday with a team coding challange that emphasizes on
   collaborative coding and computing.
